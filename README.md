## POP'N'BUBBLE ! 
Here's a project I made while learning to use Vuejs.  
A website presenting a *fake* bubble tea shop in which the user can read the menu, contact the shop's owner and make a "click'n'collect" order. I added some animations and design to make the users feel like (s)he's actually in a bubble tea.  
For this project I used the following techs :  
**Front-end** : Vuejs 3 with Options API, Pinia for the store and Vue Router; including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Deployed on Netlify.
**Back-end** : CMS : Strapi, with Cloudinary as a storage place and a PostgreSQL database. Deployed on heroku.  
**Animations librairies** : AOS, Animate.css, Swiper.

You can see the result here :
